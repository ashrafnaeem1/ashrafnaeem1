Let's see where this path will take me — or maybe even you.<br>
I genuinely believe that all lives are connected somehow.<br>

Although, my repos are a stub currently.

### 📖 Here's some verses from the beautiful Qur’an to reward you:

> **[Qur’an 93 — Ad-Duhaa]** <br>
> By the morning sunlight, <br>
> and the night when it falls still! <br>
> Your Lord has not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful of you. <br>
> And the next life is certainly far better for you than this one. <br>
> ***And your Lord will give so much to you that you will be pleased.*** <br>
> Did He not find you as an orphan, then sheltered you? [1] <br>
> And did He not find you unguided, then guide you? <br>
> And did He not find you needy, then fulfill your needs? [2] <br>
> ***So do NOT oppress the orphan.*** <br>
> ***Nor repulse the beggar (or anyone asking for help).*** [3] <br>
> ***And proclaim the blessings of your Lord.*** <br>
 <br>
Footnotes: <br>
1. [A reference to the Prophet (Peace and Blessings be Upon Him)] <br>
2. [Allah is The One and Only Who fulfils one’s need of everything — shelter, food, clothing, or anything else] <br>
3. [The word used is *Saa-il* → one asking for help/need, rather than *Faqir* → beggar] <br>
