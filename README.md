### 📖 Here's some verses from the beautiful Qur’an to reward you:

> **[Qur’an 93 — Ad-Duhaa]**
> By the morning sunlight,
> and the night when it falls still!
> Your Lord has not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful of you.
> And the next life is certainly far better for you than this one.
> ***And your Lord will give so much to you that you will be pleased.***
> Did He not find you as an orphan, then sheltered you? [1]
> And did He not find you unguided, then guide you?
> And did He not find you needy, then fulfill your needs? [2]
> ***So do NOT oppress the orphan.***
> ***Nor repulse the beggar (or anyone asking for help).*** [3]
> ***And proclaim the blessings of your Lord.***

**Footnotes:**
1. [A reference to the Prophet (Peace and Blessings be Upon Him)]
2. [Allah is The One and Only Who fulfils one’s need of everything — shelter, food, clothing, or anything else]
3. [The word used is *Saa-il* → one asking for help/need, rather than *Faqir* → beggar]
